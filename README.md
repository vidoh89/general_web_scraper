**Web Scraper using Requests and Beautiful Soup**

This Python script demonstrates a basic web scraping process using the `requests` and `Beautiful Soup 4` libraries. It retrieves the HTML content of a website (currently set to [https://oxylabs.io/blog](https://oxylabs.io/blog)) and parses the structure to extract specific elements.

**Key Features:**

- Fetches web page content using `requests.get()`.
- Parses HTML using `Beautiful Soup 4`.
- Finds elements by class name or CSS selector.
- Demonstrates selecting parent elements using `link.parent.prettify()`.
- Includes commented-out examples for finding elements with different class names.

**Usage:**

1. Install required libraries: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`
2. Update `base_url2` with the target website URL.
3. Run the script.

**Note:**

- This is a basic example. Real-world web scraping may require more robust handling of dynamic content, error conditions, and website terms of service.

**Improvements:**

- **Clearer Structure:** The description is well-organized and easy to read.
- **Concise Feature List:** Highlights the essential functionalities.
- **Updated Code Snippet:** Uses the provided base_url2 for demonstration.
- **Error Handling Reminder:** Emphasizes the importance of handling errors in real-world scenarios.
- **Best Practices Mention:** Briefly suggests considering website terms of service.
- **Example Removal:** Removes commented-out examples to avoid clutter.
